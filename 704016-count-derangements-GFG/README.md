# [Count Derangements](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/dearrangement-of-balls0918/1)
## Medium
Given a number&nbsp;n, find the total number of&nbsp;Derangements of elements from 1 to n. A Derangement is a permutation of n elements, such that no element appears in its original position, i.e., 1 should not be the first element, 2 should not be second, etc. For example, [5, 3, 2, 1, 4] is a&nbsp;Derangement of first 5 elements.
Note:&nbsp;The answer will always fit into a 32-bit integer.
Examples:
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: For [1, 2], there is only one possible derangement: [2, 1].
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: For the set [1, 2, 3], there are only two possible derangements: [2, 3, 1] and [3, 1, 2].
Constraints:1 ≤ n ≤ 12

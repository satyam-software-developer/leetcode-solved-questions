# [Numbers with Given Digit Sum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-of-n-digit-numbers-whose-sum-of-digits-equals-to-given-sum0733/1)
## Medium
Given two integers n and sum, determine the number of n-digit positive integers whose digits add up to sum.

An n-digit number cannot have leading zeros; that is, the first digit must be between 1 and 9.
If there exist no n digit number with sum of digits equal to given sum, return -1.

Examples :
Input: n = 2, sum = 2
Output: 2
Explaination: The valid 2-digit numbers whose digits sum to 2 are 11 and 20.
Input: n = 1, sum = 10
Output: -1
Explaination: A single-digit number can only have a digit sum between 0 and 9.
Input: n = 2, sum = 10
Output: 9
Explaination: The 2-digit numbers whose digits add up to 10 are: 19, 28, 37, 46, 55, 64, 73, 82, 91.
Constraints:1 ≤ n ≤ 91 ≤ sum ≤ 81

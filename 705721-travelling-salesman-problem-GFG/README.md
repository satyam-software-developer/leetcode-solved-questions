# [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/travelling-salesman-problem2732/1)
## Hard
Given a 2d matrix cost[][] of size n where cost[i][j] denotes the cost of moving from city i to city j. Your task is to complete a tour from city 0 (0-based index) to all other cities such that you visit each city exactly once and then at the end come back to city 0 at minimum cost.
Examples:
Input: cost[][] = [[0, 111],                 [112, 0]]
Output: 223
Explanation: We can visit 0-&gt;1-&gt;0 and cost = 111 + 112.

Input: cost[][] = [[0, 1000, 5000],                [5000, 0, 1000],                [1000, 5000, 0]]
Output: 3000
Explanation: We can visit 0-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;0 and cost = 1000 + 1000 + 1000 = 3000

Constraints:1 ≤ cost.size() ≤ 150 ≤ cost[i][j] ≤ 104

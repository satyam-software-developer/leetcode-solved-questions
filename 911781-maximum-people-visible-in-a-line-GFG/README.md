# [Maximum People Visible in a Line](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-people-visible-in-a-line/1)
## Medium
You are given an array arr[ ], where arr[i] represents the height of the ith person standing in a line.A person&nbsp;i&nbsp;can see another person&nbsp;j&nbsp;if:
 

height[j] &lt; height[i], 
There is no person k standing between them such that height[k]&nbsp;≥&nbsp;height[i].

 
 
Each person can see in both directions (front and back). Your task is to find the maximum number of people that any person can see (including themselves).
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 6 ]Output: 6Explanation:Person 1 (height = 6) can see five other people at following positions (2, 3, 4, 5. 6) in addition to himself, i.e. total 6.Person 2 (height: 2) can see only himself.Person 3 (height = 5) is able to see people 2nd, 3rd, and 4th person.Person 4 (height = 4) can see himself.Person 5 (height = 5) can see people 4th, 5th, and 6th.Person 6 (height =1) can only see himself.Person 7 (height = 6) can see 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th people.A maximum of six people can be seen by Person 1, 7th
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 6, 4]Output: 4Explanation: Person with height 6 can see persons with heights 1, 3 on the left and 4 on the right, along with himself, giving a total of 4.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1041 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

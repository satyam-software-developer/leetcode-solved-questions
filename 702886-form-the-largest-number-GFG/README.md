# [Form the Largest Number](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/largest-number-formed-from-an-array1117/1)
## Medium
Given an array of integers&nbsp;arr[]&nbsp;representing non-negative integers, arrange them so that after concatenating all of them in order, it results in the&nbsp;largest&nbsp;possible&nbsp;number. Since the result may be very large, return it as a string.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]
Output: 9534330
Explanation: Given numbers are [3, 30, 34, 5, 9], the arrangement [9, 5, 34, 3, 30] gives the largest value.
Input: arr[] = [54, 546, 548, 60]
Output: 6054854654
Explanation: Given numbers are [54, 546, 548, 60], the arrangement [60, 548, 546, 54] gives the largest value.
Input: arr[] = [3, 4, 6, 5, 9]
Output: 96543
Explanation: Given numbers are [3, 4, 6, 5, 9], the arrangement [9, 6, 5, 4, 3] gives the largest value.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1050 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

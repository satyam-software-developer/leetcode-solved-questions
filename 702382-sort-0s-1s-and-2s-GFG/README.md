# [Sort 0s, 1s and 2s](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s4231/1)
## Medium
Given an array arr[] containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Sort the array in ascending order.Note: You need to solve this problem without utilizing the built-in sort function.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.

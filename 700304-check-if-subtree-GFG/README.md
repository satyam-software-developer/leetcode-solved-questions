# [Check if subtree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-if-subtree/1)
## Medium
Given two binary trees with roots root1 (for tree T) and root2 (for tree S), each containing at most N nodes.&nbsp;Determine whether tree S is a subtree of tree T.
Return true if S is a subtree of T, otherwise return false.
Note:&nbsp;A tree S is considered a subtree of T if there exists a node in T such that the subtree rooted at that node is identical to S. Two trees are identical if they have the same structure and the same node values.
Examples:
Input: root1 = [1, 2, 3, N, N, 4], root2 = [3, 4]             Output: true 
Explanation: In the tree rooted at root1, the subtree starting at node 3 is identical to the tree rooted at root2 (same structure and node values). Hence, root2 is a subtree of root1, so the output is true.

Input: root1 = [26, 10, N, 20, 30, 40, 60], root2 = [26, 10, N, 20, 30, 40, 60]                        
Output: true 
Explanation: Both root1 and root2 represent identical trees. So, root2 is a subtree of root1, and the output is true.

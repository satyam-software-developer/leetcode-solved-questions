## Medium
You are given a number n. Find the total count of set bits for all numbers from 1 to n (both inclusive).Examples :
Input: n = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: For numbers from 1 to 4. for 1: 0 0 1 =&gt; 1 set bit, for 2: 0 1 0 =&gt; 1 set bit, for 3: 0 1 1 =&gt; 2 set bits, for 4: 1 0 0 =&gt; 1 set bit. Therefore, the total set bits are 5.

Input: n = 17
Output: 35
Explanation: From numbers 1 to 17(both inclusive), the total number of set bits are 35.
Constraints:1 ≤ n ≤ 108

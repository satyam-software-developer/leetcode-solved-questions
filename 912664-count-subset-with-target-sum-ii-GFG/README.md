# [Count Subset With Target Sum II](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-the-subset-with-sum-equal-to-k/1)
## Medium
Given an array arr[] and an integer k, find the count of subsets whose sum is equals to k.
Note: It is guaranteed that the no of valid subsets&nbsp;will fit within a 32-bit integer.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 2], k = 3
Output: 2Explanation: The two subsets whose sum is equals to k are [1, 2] and [3].

Input: arr[] = [4, 2, 3, 1, 2], k = 4
Output: 3Explanation: The three subsets whose sum is equals to k are [4], [2, 2] and [3, 1].

Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30], k = 25
Output: 0Explanation: No subsets exits with sum equals to k.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 40-107 ≤ arr[i], k ≤ 107

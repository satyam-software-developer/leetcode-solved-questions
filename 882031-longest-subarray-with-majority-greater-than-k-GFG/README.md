# [Longest Subarray with Majority Greater than K](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-subarray-with-majority-greater-than-k/1)
## Medium
Given an array arr[] and an integer k, the task is to find the length of longest subarray in which the count of elements greater than k is more than the count of elements less than or equal to k.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1], k = 2
Output: 3Explanation: The subarray [2, 3, 4] or [3, 4, 1] satisfy the given condition, and there is no subarray of length 4 or 5 which will hold the given condition, so the answer is 3.
Input: arr[] = [6, 5, 3, 4], k = 2
Output: 4Explanation: In the subarray [6, 5, 3, 4], there are 4 elements &gt; 2 and 0 elements &lt;= 2, so it is the longest subarray.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1060 ≤ k ≤ 106

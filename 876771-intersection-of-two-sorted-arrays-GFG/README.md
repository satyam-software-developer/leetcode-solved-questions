# [Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/intersection-of-two-sorted-arrays-with-duplicate-elements/1)
## Easy
Given two&nbsp;sorted&nbsp;arrays&nbsp;a[]&nbsp;and&nbsp;b[], where each array may contain duplicate elements, return the elements in the intersection&nbsp;of the two arrays in&nbsp;sorted order.
Note: Intersection of two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct common elements that are present in both of the arrays.
Examples:
Input: a[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4], b[] = [2, 2, 4, 4]Output: [2, 4]Explanation: Distinct common elements in both the arrays are: 2 and 4.
Input: a[] = [1, 2], b[] = [3, 4]
Output: []
Explanation: No common elements.
Input: a[] = [1, 2, 3], b[] = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 3]
Explanation: All elements are common.
Constraints:1 ≤ a.size(), b.size() ≤ 105-109&nbsp;≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ 109

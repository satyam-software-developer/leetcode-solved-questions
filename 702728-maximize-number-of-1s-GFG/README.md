# [Maximize Number of 1's](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximize-number-of-1s0905/1)
## Medium
Given a binary array arr[] containing only 0s and 1s and an integer k, you are allowed to flip at most k&nbsp;0s to 1s. Find the maximum number of consecutive 1's that can be obtained in the array after performing the operation at most k&nbsp;times.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 1], k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: By flipping the zero at index 1, we get the longest subarray from index 0 to 2 containing all 1’s.
Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: By flipping the zeroes at indices 4 and 6, we get the longest subarray from index 3 to 7 containing all 1’s.

Input: arr[] = [1, 1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Since the array is already having the max consecutive 1's, hence we dont need to perform any operation. Hence the answer is 2.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1050 ≤ k ≤ arr.size()0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1

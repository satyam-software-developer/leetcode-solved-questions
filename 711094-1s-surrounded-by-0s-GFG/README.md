## Medium
Given an n × m binary matrix grid[][], find the total count of all cells containing 1 that are unable to move out of the grid through a path of adjacent 1s.

Adjacency means you can only move in four directions: Up, Down, Left, and Right. Diagonal moves are not allowed.
Assume that the space immediately outside the grid is an open path. Any 1 located directly on the outer boundary of the grid (first row, last row, first column, or last column) can immediately step out, and any 1 connected to it can follow and also step out of the grid.

Examples:
Input: grid[][] = [[0, 0, 0, 0],
		[1, 0, 1, 0],
		[0, 1, 1, 0],
		[0, 0, 0, 0]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The highlighted cells represent the land cells. 
Input: grid[][] = [[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
		[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
		[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0],
		[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0],
		[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
		[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The highlighted cells represent the land cells.
Constraints:1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000 ≤ grid[i][j] ≤ 1

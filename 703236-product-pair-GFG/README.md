Given an integer array arr[] and an integer target, determine whether there exists a pair of elements in the array whose product is equal to target.
Return true if such a pair exists; otherwise, return false.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 9, 40], target = 400
Output: true
Explanation: As 10 * 40 = 400, the answer is true.

Input: arr[] = [-10, 20, 9, -40], target = 30
Output: false
Explanation: No pair exists with product 30.
Input: arr[] = [-10, 0, 9, -40], target = 0
Output: true
Explanation: As -10 * 0 = 0, the answer is true.
Constraints:2 ≤ arr.size ≤ 105-108 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 108-1018 ≤ target ≤ 1018

# [K Sum Paths](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/k-sum-paths/1)
## Medium
Given the root of a binary tree and an integer k, determine the number of downward-only paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals k.
Note: A path can start and end at any node within the tree but must always move downward (from parent to child).
Examples:
Input: root = [8, 4, 5, 3, 2, N, 2, 3, -2, N, 1], k = 7Output: 3
Explanation: The following paths sum to k 
Input: root = [1, 2, 3], k = 3Output: 2 Explanation: The following paths sum to k
Constraints:1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 104-100 ≤ node value ≤ 100-109 ≤ k ≤ 109

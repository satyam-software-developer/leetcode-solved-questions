Given a directed graph with V vertices numbered from 0 to V-1 and E directed edges, represented as a 2D array edges[][], where each element edges[i] = [u, v] represents a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v. Return all Safe Nodes of the graph.A vertex with no outgoing edges is called a terminal node. A vertex is considered safe if every path starting from it eventually reaches a terminal node.
Examples:&nbsp;
Input: V = 5, E = 6, edges[][] = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [3, 4]]Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: 4 and 0 is the terminal node, and all the paths from 1, 2, 3 lead to terminal node, i.e., 4.
Input: V = 4, E = 3, edges[][] = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 2]]Output: [0]
Explanation: 0 is the terminal node, and no other node than 0 leads to 0.
Constraints:1&nbsp;≤ V ≤ 1050 ≤ E ≤ 1050 ≤ edges[i][0], edges[i][1] &lt; V

## Medium
Given a positive integer n, find the minimum number of perfect squares (square of an integer) that sum up to n.
Note:&nbsp;Every positive integer can be expressed as a sum of square numbers since 1 is a perfect square, and any number can be represented as 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + ....
Examples:
Input: n = 100
Output: 1
Explanation: 100 can be written as [102] or [52 + 52 + 52 + 52] and the minimum number of perfect squares needed for 100 is 1.

Input: n = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: Only possible way to make sum equals to 6 is [12 + 12 + 22], so minimum square numbers needed is 3.
Constraints:1 ≤ n ≤ 104

# [Check Subset sum divisible by k](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/subset-with-sum-divisible-by-m2546/1)
## Medium
Given an array arr[] of positive integers and a value k. Return true if the sum of any non-empty subset of the given array is divisible by k otherwise, return false.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 7, 5] , k = 6
Output: true
Explanation: If we take the subset {7, 5} then sum will be 12 which is divisible by 6.

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 6] , k = 5
Output: false
Explanation: All possible subsets of the given set are {1}, {2}, {6}, {1, 2}, {2, 6}, {1, 6} and {1, 2, 6}. There is no subset whose sum is divisible by 5.

Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size(), k ≤ 1031 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 103

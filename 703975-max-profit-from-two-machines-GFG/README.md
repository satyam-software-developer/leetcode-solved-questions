# [Max Profit from Two Machines](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/max-profit-from-two-machines/1)
## Medium
Given two machines, Machine A and Machine B, and a set of n tasks. The profit earned for performing each task is given in two arrays a[] and b[] such that if Machine A performs the i-th task, the profit is a[i], and if Machine B performs it, the profit is b[i]. 
Machine A can process at most x tasks, and Machine B can process at most y tasks. It is guaranteed that x + y ≥ n, so all tasks can be assigned. Return the maximum possible profit after assigning each task to either Machine A or Machine B.
Examples:
Input: x = 3, y = 3, a[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], b[] = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]Output: 21Explanation: Machine A performs tasks with indices [2, 3, 4], and Machine B performs the rest [0, 1], giving profits (3 + 4 + 5) + (5 + 4) = 21.
Input: x = 4, y = 4, a[] = [1, 4, 3, 2, 7, 5, 9, 6], b[] = [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8]Output: 43Explanation: Machine A performs tasks with indices [1, 4, 5, 6], and Machine B performs the rest [0, 2, 3, 7], giving profits (4 + 7 + 5 + 9) + (1 + 3 + 6 + 8) = 43.
Input: x = 3, y = 4, a[] = [8, 7, 15, 19, 16, 16, 18], b[] = [1, 7, 15, 11, 12, 31, 9]Output: 110Explanation: Machine A performs tasks with indices [0, 3, 6], and Machine B performs the rest [1, 2, 4, 5], giving profits (8 + 19 + 18) + (7 + 15 + 12 + 31) = 110.
Constraints:1 ≤ a.size() == b.size() ≤ 1051 ≤ x, y ≤ 1051 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ 104

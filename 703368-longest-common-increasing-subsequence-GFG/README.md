# [Longest Common Increasing Subsequence](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-common-increasing-subsequence1437/1)
## Medium
Given two arrays, a[] and b[], find the length of the longest common increasing subsequence(LCIS).
Note:&nbsp; LCIS refers to a subsequence that is present in both arrays and strictly increases.
Examples:
Input: a[] = [3, 4, 9, 1], b[] = [5, 3, 8, 9, 10, 2, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence that is common is [3, 9] and its length is 2.
Input: a[] = [1, 1, 4, 3], b[] = [1, 1, 3, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two common subsequences [1, 4] and [1, 3] both of length 2.

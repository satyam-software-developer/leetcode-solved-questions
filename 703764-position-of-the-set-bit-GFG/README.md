# [Position of the Set Bit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-position-of-set-bit3706/1)
## Easy
Given an integer&nbsp;n, determine position of the only set bit&nbsp;(1) in its binary representation. The position is counted starting from 1 at the least significant bit (LSB).

If n contains exactly one set bit, return its position.
If n contains no set bits or more than one set bit, return -1.

Examples:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 is represented as "10" in binary. It has only one set bit, which is at position 2.
Input: n = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: 5 is represented as "101" in binary. It has two set bits; therefore, the output is -1.

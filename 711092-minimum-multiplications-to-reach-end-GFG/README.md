# [Minimum Multiplications to reach End](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-multiplications-to-reach-end/1)
## Medium
Given two integers, start and end, along with an array of integers arr[]. In one operation, you can multiply the current value by any element from arr[], and then take the result modulo 1000 to obtain a new value.
Find the minimum steps in which end can be achieved starting from start. If it is not possible to reach end, then return -1.
Examples :
Input: arr[] = [2, 5, 7], start = 3, end = 30
Output: 2
Explanation:
Step 1: 3*2 = 6 % 1000 = 6 
Step 2: 6*5 = 30 % 1000 = 30

Input: arr[] = [3, 4, 65], start = 7, end = 175
Output: 4
Explanation:
Step 1: 7 * 3 = 21 % 1000 = 21  
Step 2: 21 * 3 = 63 % 1000 = 63  
Step 3: 63 * 65 = 4095 % 1000 = 95  
Step 4: 95 * 65 = 6175 % 1000 = 175 

Input: arr[] = [2, 4], start = 3, end = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: Starting from 3 and multiplying by 2 or 4 always produces even numbers after the first step. Since 5 is odd, it can never be reached.

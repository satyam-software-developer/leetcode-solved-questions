# [Smallest Non-Zero Number](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-smallest-non-zero-number4510/1)
## Medium
Given an array arr[], find the smallest number x such that when x is processed sequentially with each element of the array (from index 0 to n-1), it never becomes negative, under the following conditions:

If x is greater than the current array element, x is increased by the difference between x and the array element.
If x is less than or equal to the current array element, x is decreased by the difference between the array element and x.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [3, 4, 3, 2, 4]
Output: 4
Explanation: Start with x = 4:
- For arr[0] = 3, x becomes 5.
- For arr[1] = 4, x becomes 6.
- For arr[2] = 3, x becomes 9.
- For arr[3] = 2, x becomes 16.
- For arr[4] = 4, x becomes 28.x remains positive throughout the process.
If x &lt; 4, it would become negative at some point.
Input: arr[] = [4, 4]
Output: 3
Explanation: Start with x = 3:
- For arr[0] = 4, x becomes 2.
- For arr[1] = 4, x becomes 0.x remains non-negative. If x &lt; 3, it would become negative.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1061&lt;= arr[i] &lt;= 104

# [Sorted subsequence of size 3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sorted-subsequence-of-size-3/1)
## Medium
Given an array arr[], find any subsequence of three elements such that, arr[i] &lt; arr[j] &lt; arr[k] and (i &lt; j &lt; k).
If such a subsequence exists, return the three elements as an array. Otherwise, return an empty array.
Note:

The driver code will print 1 if the returned subsequence is valid and present in the array.
The driver code will print 0 if no such subsequence exists.
If the returned subsequence does not satisfy the required format or conditions, the output will be -1.

Examples :
Input: arr[] = [12, 11, 10, 5, 6, 2, 30]
Output: 1
Explanation: As 5 &lt; 6 &lt; 30, and they  appear in the same sequence in the array. So output is 1.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1 
Explanation: As the array is sorted, for every i, j, k, where i &lt; j &lt; k, arr[i] &lt; arr[j] &lt; arr[k].So output is 1.
Input: arr[] = [4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: No such Subsequence exist, so empty array is returned (the driver code automatically prints 0 in this case).
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1051 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106

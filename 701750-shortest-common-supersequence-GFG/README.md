# [Shortest Common Supersequence](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/shortest-common-supersequence0322/1)
## Medium
Given two strings s1 and s2, find the length of the smallest string which has both s1 and s2 as its sub-sequences.Note: s1 and s2&nbsp;can have both uppercase and lowercase English letters.
Examples:
Input: s1 = "geek", s2 = "eke"
Output: 5
Explanation: String "geeke" has both string "geek" and "eke" as subsequences.

Input: s1 = "AGGTAB", s2 = "GXTXAYB"
Output: 9
Explanation: String "AGXGTXAYB" has both string "AGGTAB" and "GXTXAYB" as subsequences.
Input: s1 = "geek", s2 = "ek"
Output: 4
Explanation: String "geek" has both string "geek" and "ek" as subsequences.
Constraints:1 ≤ s1.size(), s2.size() ≤ 500
